The project "Cleaning & Getting Data Assignment" evaluate the capacity to download and collect data and cleaning it.

Using the dataset from  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, 
I create the script 'run_analysis.R' to do the following:

1. Downloads the data from the URL mentioned before.
2. Reads the data downloaded
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts the mean and standard deviation. 
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
7. Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
