# R - Getting and Cleaning Data
Using the dataset from  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, 
I create the script 'run_analysis.R.R' to do the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Names the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
